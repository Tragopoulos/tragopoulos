### Cloud Engineering Manager @Deloitte - Dev & DevOps

----

Being in the founding scheme of companies in the past has allowed me to refine excellent leadership skills and to understand what challenges businesses face. I implemented new ideas in both start-ups and well-branded companies and managed projects and teams in R&D and production. I am an advocate of agile methodologies who also loves coding, designing solution architectures, automating activities, building great products and helping businesses to succeed. I enjoy teaching, specifically design patterns and best practices. I am a strong believer of the power of positive thinking and enjoy discussing the latest technologies and trends.
